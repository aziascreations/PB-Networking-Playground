# PB-Networking-Playground

A collection of small programs and demos who play around with networking in PureBasic.


## Categories

The sub-pages for each sub-category will list all the projects in more details and indicate which OS APIs were used.

### Protocol & Components

<!--These programs only play around with a single protocol or basic networking component.-->

<b>[ARP](ARP/)</b><br>
These projects focus on the basic uses of the ARP protocol like listing network devices and sending gratuitous ARP packets.

<b>[DHCP](DHCP/)</b><br>
Contains some basic programs that compose, parse and respond to some DHCP packets.

<b>[DNS](DNS/)</b><br>
Consists of a simple ???

<b>[MAC](MAC/)</b><br>
Some stuff about MAC vendors.

<b>[Wake-On-Lan](WakeOnLan/)</b><br>
Only consists of a basic WOL packet sender.<br>
<br>


### Software

<!--These programs only play around with a specific application.-->

<b>[Minecraft](Minecraft/)</b><br>

<!--Any sub-category that can't fit in any of the main categories.-->

<b>[Exploits](Exploits/)</b><br>
This category is comprised of simple exploits that may use one or more protocols or affects some applications.<br>
Some projects present in other categories might be referenced here, they normally are in their own category if they affect one specific protocol or application.
