### [ThreadedSendARP](WinAPI-ThreadedSendARP/)&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub><sup>WinAPI</sup></sub>

This program sends a bunch of ARP requests for all the devices within a hard-coded IP range.<br>
It does it with the help of a threaded procedure to avoid waiting for the request to timeout and then reports back with the IPs and malformed MACs.
